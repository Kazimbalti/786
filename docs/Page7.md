# Autonomous Drone

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of building an autonomous drone using the PX4 and Ardupilot platforms. Autonomous drones have a wide range of applications, from aerial photography to search and rescue missions. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional autonomous drone capable of executing pre-planned missions.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Hardware Requirements:**
  - Drone frame and components
  - Flight controller
  - GPS module
  - Motors and propellers
  - Battery and charger
  - Radio transmitter and receiver
  - Computer for development
  - USB cable, connectors, and tools

- **Software Requirements:**
  - [PX4 Firmware](https://docs.px4.io/v1.11.0/en/getting_started/quick_start.html)
  - [Ardupilot Firmware](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-building-and-loading-arducopter.html)
  - [Mission Planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-installation.html) or [QGroundControl](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/getting_started/download_and_install.html)
  
## Setting Up the Drone Hardware

- Assemble the drone hardware according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- Pay careful attention to safety precautions during assembly.

## Installing PX4 and Ardupilot

### PX4

- Install PX4 firmware on the flight controller using [QGroundControl](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/getting_started/qgc_installation.html) or manually.
- Verify the installation.

### Ardupilot

- Install Ardupilot firmware on the flight controller using [Mission Planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/common-install-mission-planner.html) or manually.
- Ensure successful installation.

## Configuring the Flight Controller

### PX4

- Configure the flight controller settings using [QGroundControl](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/getting_started/qgc_settings.html).
- Set up essential parameters for autonomous flight.
- Define flight modes and their settings.

### Ardupilot

- Configure the flight controller settings through [Mission Planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/common-initial-setup.html).
- Define flight modes and configure safety checks.
- Adjust important parameters for autonomous missions.

## Programming the Autonomous Behavior

- Discuss the importance of mission planning and flight paths.
- Explain how to plan missions using Mission Planner or QGroundControl.
- Include examples of mission scripts and commands.

## Testing and Calibration

- Emphasize the importance of calibration for sensors and compass.
- Detail the calibration process for both PX4 and Ardupilot.

## Autonomous Flight Testing

- Provide instructions for conducting autonomous flight tests.
- Explain how to monitor and analyze flight data.
- Include safety guidelines for testing.

## Troubleshooting

- List common issues and errors during autonomous flight.
- Provide solutions and troubleshooting steps.
